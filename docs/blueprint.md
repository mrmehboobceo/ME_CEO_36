# **App Name**: CampusConnect

## Core Features:

- User Dashboards: Role-based dashboards: Principal, Teacher, Student, and Parent, each providing relevant information and functionalities.
- Student Records: Student Management: Allows manual addition and editing of student records, including details like name, class, date of birth, and parent information. Includes CSV upload.
- Teacher Management: Teacher Management: Enables manual addition and editing of teacher records, as well as teacher-class assignment functionalities.
- Attendance System: Attendance Tracking: Teachers can mark daily attendance, and the system generates weekly/monthly reports. Students and parents can view attendance records.
- Fee Management: Simulated Fee Payment: Simulates fee payment processing, allowing students and parents to view fee status and due dates. A payment alert notification will appear, and fees can be paid. Admins can view the fake payment, filter and export these records. This is a simulated workflow, so money doesn't change hands.
- Leave System: Leave Application: Allows students to submit leave requests with dates and reasons, and enables principals to approve or reject these requests.
- Personalized Notifications: Smart Notification Tool: AI analyzes user behavior to personalize notifications. Using provided user data (attendance records, fee payment status, and general announcements), this tool prioritizes relevant notifications, ensuring users receive timely and important updates.  Reasoning and user preferences decide the content of generated simulated WhatsApp messages.  If absence is logged, or payment is outstanding, it will determine appropriate simulated alert for parent

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #4CAF50 (Green) to evoke a sense of growth, learning, and trustworthiness. It will be balanced and calm, drawing on the visual associations between education and nature.
- Background color: #F0F8E0, a very light desaturation of the green primary, used as the app's backdrop for a consistent visual link between different areas, while remaining gentle and non-intrusive.
- Accent color: #3F51B5 (Indigo) - Chosen for its position to the 'left' of green on the color wheel. This accent serves to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action without overpowering the calming green backdrop. Contrast with background and primary colors.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, providing a modern and readable typeface suitable for both headings and body text. 'PT Sans' will make all information presented in an organized format.
- Use simple, line-based icons for easy recognition and a modern aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout to organize information effectively and responsively across different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience without being distracting.
